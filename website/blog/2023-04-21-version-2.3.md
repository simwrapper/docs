Version 2.3 is now live on [simwrapper.github.io](https://simwrapper.github.io) and also on [vsp.berlin/simwrapper](https://vsp.berlin/simwrapper)!

**Plotly charts:** The original bar/area/line charts are simplified versions of the well-known [Plotly](https://www.plotly.com/javascript) charting library. They are deliberately simplified so that you can create simple plots quickly. They are still available. But if you want more power, SimWrapper now exposes all Plotly chart types, even non-cartesian plots, 3-D, and more: explore the new [Plotly plugin](../docs/plotly).

**Tiles plugin:** Do you need to highlight just one value in a top-level dashboard? Check out the new `type: tile` dashboard plugin here: [Tiles](../docs/tiles)

**Lots of bugfixes:** Version 2.3 includes many, many bugfixes in the shapefile viewer and MATSim roadway and transit network readers. Thanks for the bug reports!

See the [Change Log](../docs/changelog) for the full list of updates.
