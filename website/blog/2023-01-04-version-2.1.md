Version 2.1 is on [vsp.berlin/simwrapper](https://vsp.berlin/simwrapper) and also on [simwrapper.github.io](https://simwrapper.github.io)!

This is mostly a bugfix update, with some new features in the Flowmap and some other visualizations.

**Simpler dashboard configuration:** Dashboard configuration files have been "flattened" a bit, meaning that there isn't so much indentation required anymore because the old `props` section has been merged with the standard layout fields for all cards. You can see some examples on the [Dashboard docs page](../docs/guide-dashboards#full-example-dashboard-summaryyaml)

Review the [Change Log](https://simwrapper.github.io/docs/changelog) for the full list of updates.
