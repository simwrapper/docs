SimWrapper has a new home: **https://simwrapper.app**

The project has outgrown the old github.io URLs and needed a place of its own. Nothing else has changed about the project or website: it is still a 100% open source, static website developed in the open on GitHub. All of the source code remains on GitHub too. Only the URLs for actually using the tool and its documentation have changed.

Main site: [simwrapper.app](https://simwrapper.app)

Documentation (you are here): [docs.simwrapper.app](https://docs.simwrapper.app/docs)
