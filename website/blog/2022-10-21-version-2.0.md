## Version 2.0 is out now

Version 2 is on [vsp.berlin/simwrapper](https://vsp.berlin/simwrapper) and also on [simwrapper.github.io](https://simwrapper.github.io)!

This is a big update with lots of new features. Some are fully baked and others are still in development, as we collect data from users on how best to deploy them.

## New features

**Big improvements to Shapefile and GeoJSON viewer:** San Francisco County Transportation Authority sponsored development on the shapefile/areamap/GeoJSON viewer. Much better symbology, filters, difference plots, and normalized data capabilities are all included now. Both polygon-based maps and link-based (network) line shapefiles are now supported, which enables area maps and network plots to be displayed easily.

**New left-navigation panel:** The unhideable, not-very-useful left nav bar has been replaced with a multipurpose panel that lets you navigate your filesystem independently of the views that are displayed in the main panel. And you can hide it!

**Embeddable maps:** The new shapefile viewer (and soon all maps) can be embedded in other websites and project portals by appending `?embed` to the end of the URL. This removes all the Simwrapper "chrome" and widgets, leaving a clean map that can be included in your external project site.

**Drag and drop views:** You can double-click or drag/drop visualization panels from the left-nav onto the main area, creating split-pane views on the fly

**Simpler dashboard YAML syntax:** YAML requires careful indentation, and SimWrapper dashboard YAML files had many many levels of indentation. We've eliminated the pesky `props:` subsection from dashboards, and users can now place all of their viz configuration at the same level. Much easier to read, and less buggy!

**X/Y/T point data viz:** A new disaggregate point-data viewer displays lat/long point data with a time-slider component. Useful for point-based emissions, noise, and other data (experimental)

**MATSim event viewer:** Initial version of a MATSim event animation viewer. We finally cracked the difficult problem of streaming larger-than-memory XML files inside a browser tab. Event files load, but are slow to do so. We're gathering user feedback at VSP Berlin on how to fully integrate this into SimWrapper (experimental)

And many many bugfixes. See the [Change Log](https://simwrapper.github.io/docs/changelog) for the full list.
